1. Target1
Vulnerability: The vulnerability of target1.c is at line 8. The input string argv[1] is copied to buf without checking the length. 
               Since the size of the buf is 96, the input longer than 96 would cause a buffer overflow problem. 
Exploit: We could exploit this buffer overflow problem by inputting a large-size argv[1]. 
         Then the strcpy() function at line 8 would copy the input to the buf on the stack. 
         Finally, it would overwrite the return address of the function lab_main at address 0x3021fec8 by the input characters. 
         Thus, we could write the address of the shellcode at this position. Then the process would execute the shellcode when it returns.

3. Target3
Vulnerability: The vulnerability of target3.c is at line 14. The element of the input string argv[1] is copied to buf one by one. 
               The restriction of the copy length ltarg, which is 88. Since the size of the buf is 64, 
               an input longer than 64 would cause a buffer overflow problem. 
Exploit: We could exploit this buffer overflow problem by inputting a large-size argv[1]. 
         Then the element copy process at line 8 would copy the input to the buf on the stack. 
         Finally, it would overwrite the return address of the function foo at address 0x3021fe98 by the input characters. 
         Thus, we could write the address of the shellcode at this position. Then the process would execute the shellcode when it returns.
         One thing to notice is that the copy process starts at 0x3021fe54, not 0x3021fe50 due to the process at line 13.
